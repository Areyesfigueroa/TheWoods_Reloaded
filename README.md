This project is the mobile version of The-Woods which will be available
for download as soon as it is complete. This is a non-profit/personal project
that me and my team felt, was never truly finish.

Therefore The-Woods Reloaded is our new version of the game.
Now that our team has more experience we want to polish our project and
make it downloadable for mobile devices. 

What is The-Woods:

The-Woods is a 2D mobile game developed using the free version
of unity engine. It is a stealth game in which you are a werewolf who is
hunting and eating villagers in the woods before the sun comes up and you
turn human.

Mechanically, it is a 2D fast paced stealth collectable game with certain
abilities included into the mix.
